# 10times Organization Scraper

Proof-of-concept python script which scrawls https://10times.com/events for recent events and their organizers (companies). Furthermore, company domains are looked up on 10times.com and with ClearBit's API. The latter's API key needs to be passed as an environment variable (`CLEARBIT_API_KEY`).
